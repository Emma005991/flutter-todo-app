#  Todo App (Flutter)

A modern and efficient Todo application built with Flutter.  
This app helps users manage daily tasks with a clean UI, offline storage, and theme support.

Built as part of my Flutter portfolio to demonstrate state management, local persistence, and scalable app architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- `models/` – Task data model  
- `providers/` – State management (tasks & theme)  
- `screens/` – App UI screens  
- `main.dart` – App entry point & providers setup  

Uses **Provider** for reactive UI updates and **Hive** for lightweight, fast local persistence.
